Hello, everyone. I am Casey CHOW, a student of Master of Digital Media in Victoria University.
The website I have made is a online stationery store which mainly selling aesthetic and beautiful stationery products from worldwide.
Looking for pretty stationery products is one of my interest, I like using different stationery to decorate my journals, such as stickers, washi tapes and memo pads. 
Therefore, the goal of opening a stationery store is to provide a platform for people share their ideas and opinions together. 
I hope everyone find something cute and interesting through shopping on our stationery store.
As the audiences may not get to know what kind of product they want so I put the new arrivals product at the first, helps getting people's attraction at the first.
Then, showing the best item can further attract audiences and stimulate their buying wants.
