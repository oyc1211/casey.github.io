Introduction
Hello, everyone. I am Casey CHOW, a student of Master of Digital Media in Victoria University.
The website I have made is a online stationery store which mainly selling aesthetic and beautiful stationery products from worldwide.

Background
Looking for pretty stationery products is one of my interest, I like using different stationery to decorate my journals, such as stickers, washi tapes and memo pads. 
Therefore, the goal of opening a stationery store is to provide a platform for people share their ideas and opinions together. 
I hope everyone find something cute and interesting through shopping on our stationery store.

Layout design
As the audiences may not get to know what kind of product they want so I put the new arrivals product at the first, helps getting people's attraction at the first.
Then, showing the best item can further attract audiences and stimulate their buying wants.
Usually audiences are getting attractions from the pictures so insert differnt aesthetic pictures is important. Hence, every product is embeded with picture to have a clear explaination to audiences.

UX Law
According to the aesthetic-usability effect, layout design is important. Hence, with the consideration of UX Law, clear and simple is important element in creating a website. 
Creating a table for displaying the products can clearly cataglorise and differentiate numerous products of the shop.

Strengths
The website is clear and well-understanding by audiences, as they can easily find what products they want.

Weakness
More visual elements can be added to enhance the website's attractiveness, for example the header, videos or music etc.
Product description can be added in every product in order to increase the website's completeness.

Conclusion
There are some improvements and further developments can be made for the website, especially the layout design.
